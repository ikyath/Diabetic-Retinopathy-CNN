# Diabetic_Retinopathy_CNN
In this repository,  I work with data from APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection competition where we find the severity of diabetic retinopathy using the image data and also we go through various hyperparmeters and find which the best paramteres to detect retinopathy, As the data is imbalanced in the second notebook i have augmneted the data and had better model in identifying diabetic retinopathy, With the better hyperparamteres from this notebook we are able to predict diabetic retinopathy with f1score of 67 which is high compartive the model without data augmentation.
